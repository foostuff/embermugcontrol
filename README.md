# embermugcontrol
Control Ember MugÂ² using the Bluetooth Web API

The phone app was always crashing, so I made my own Interface.

Based on info here:

Feel free to use here: https://foostuff.github.io/embermugcontrol/ or fork it or whatever.

It's not beautiful but since it works for me, I'll probably abondon this soon.
